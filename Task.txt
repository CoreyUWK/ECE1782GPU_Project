ToDo:
- What are the numbers for research group GPU processing of CNN?
    - FPGA?
    - Keras Tensorflow?

- What are numbers for basic CNN in cuda?
- What are numbers for optimized CNN in cuda?
- What are numbers for cuDNN in cuda version?

For initial implementation can use random weights and make model specific in code, with random input
Can compare results in tensorflow


- Then need numbers for memory utilization, number of parallel interferences (throughput)

- look at research papers and sources online for optimized CNN cuda implementation

- CNN research Paper vs code
